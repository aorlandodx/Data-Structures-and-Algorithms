# Data Structures and fundamental Algorithms practice
This repository is a personal collection of notes, implementations, and examples covering fundamental and advanced topics in **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. It includes a range of concepts from **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, to the design and implementation of core data structures, algorithms, and the analysis of their time and **space complexities**. It serves both as a learning reference and a demonstration of various approaches to problem solving and software design.

## Purpose
This repository is intended to:

- Consolidate my understanding of DSA concepts.
- Provide clean, well-documented code examples.
- Serve as a reference for interview preparation and future projects.
- Facilitate learning and sharing with others interested in algorithms and software design.


##  Roadmap
The repository is under active development. Planned additions include:

- More graph algorithms.
- Complexity analysis notes.
- Example projects combining multiple data structures.
- Problem-solving walkthroughs.


## Technologies
- **Languages:** C++ and Python 
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code
- **Version Control:** Git


## Contributing
Suggestions and pull requests are welcome. Feel free to open an issue or fork the repository to contribute :)
